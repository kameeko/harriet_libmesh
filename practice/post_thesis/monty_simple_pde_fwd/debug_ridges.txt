-> did previous example have ridges? also had rectangular source...if not, is it because of mesh resolution, peclet number, dirichlet BCs, or non-transience?
  -all-linear data-making
  -dx = 1/40, vmax = 0.5, k = 0.1
  -no ridges even when dx = 0.25, v = e-9, k = e-8

-setting 3D to steady-state does the weird ridges-to-the-left, smear-to-the-right thing...

-diri = 5 on west boundary doesn't help...steady state still has ridges...

-reducing velocity doesn't help, perhaps because dispersion scales with it?
-changing dispersivity to isotropic 600 removes oscillations from steady state with 30x30x30 discretization
  -might still have some less visible oscillations <<

-what if you add SUPG?
  -SUPG doesn't seem to help either...(reproduced tau from milo...)
-what if source takes up all of z?
  -does not seem to help...
  -with all diri?
    -does not seem to help...
    
4600 in x
3300 in y
100 in z
-without SUPG, if discretized elements to be 50x50x33 (nx = 92, ny = 66, nz = 3), need k/U = 400 to not let it dip below 5 anywhere...
  -Pe = LU/k, so seems like we should only need k/U = 50 to get Pe = 1
  -if keep k/U = 200, try SUPG
    -first version (from other code) barely seems the change the field (based on most negative value)
    -second version (from Eq 17 in http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/TWA_Reports/06/06-03.pdf) makes it hilariously more oscillatory...?!?
    
SHOULD YOU JUST TRY THIS IN MILO?
  -> same behavior in MILO, not problem with replication...
  
if you keep everything but the z-dimension, then at k/U = 200 you can dip below 5 but not go negative...halving mesh size makes it at all at least 5...
    -doubling tau also works
    -if set k/U = 60, then tau = 5*tau doesn't work, but tau = 10*tau fails to converge (nonlinear solver)
    -does SUPG really act like artificial viscosity? the tau doesn't even touch the diffusive bit...
    
adding decay around edges of box (nx = 92, ny = 66, nz = 3)
  -no decay: max: 4.65e3; min: -271
  -decay param 1e-1: max: 6.78e3; min: -40.3 
  -decay param 5e-2: max: 8.32e3; min: -68.6
  -decay param 2.5e-2: max: 1.07e4; min: -2.56 
  -decay param 1e-2: max: 1.6e4; min: 5
  vs changing mesh size 
    -no decay, (nx = 184, ny = 132, nz = 3): max: 4.56e3; min: -84.9
    -no decay, (nx = 368, ny = 264, nz = 3): max: 4.48e3; min: -3.54
    
mesh adaptivity
  -patch seems to do much worse than kelly, even though kelly designed for poisson?
  -refinement seems to target east side of box, not the west where it dips below 5...
  -2D: decay param 5e-2: max: ; min: --SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH 2D IT'S NOT SOLVING ANYMORE NONLINEAR SOLVER STALLS...
