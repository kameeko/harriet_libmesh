-> did previous example have ridges? also had rectangular source...if not, is it because of mesh resolution, peclet number, dirichlet BCs, or non-transience?

-setting 3D to steady-state does the weird ridges-to-the-left, smear-to-the-right thing...

-all-linear data-making
  -dx = 1/40, vmax = 0.5, k = 0.1
  -no ridges even when dx = 0.25, v = e-9, k = e-8

-diri = 5 on west boundary doesn't help...steady state still has ridges...

-reducing velocity doesn't help, perhaps because dispersion scales with it?
-changing dispersivity to isotropic 600 removes oscillations from steady state with 30x30x30 discretization
  -might still have some less visible oscillations <<

-what if you add SUPG?
  -SUPG doesn't seem to help either...(reproduced tau from milo...)?!?
-what if source takes up all of z?
  -does not seem to help...
  -with all diri?
    -does not seem to help...
    
4600 in x
3300 in y
100 in z
-without SUPG, if discretized elements to be 50x50x33, need k/U = 400 to not let it dip below 5 anywhere...
  -Pe = LU/k, so seems like we should only need k/U = 50 to get Pe = 1
  -if keep k/U = 200, try SUPG
    -first version (from other code) barely seems the change the field (based on most negative value)
    -second version (from Eq 17 in http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/TWA_Reports/06/06-03.pdf) makes it hilariously more oscillatory...?!?
    
SHOULD YOU JUST TRY THIS IN MILO?
