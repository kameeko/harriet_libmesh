-> inverse prob for LF and HF; to avoid optimization algorithm, solve KKT system
  -> which adjoint system? stabilized adjoint or transposed of stabilized jacobian? for optimization problem where we care about a particular discretization, we want to use the transpose of the stabilized forward as the adjoint...
  -> is the adjoint of the stabilized system even the stabilized adjoint-of-unstabilized?
    -what is the meaning of the adjoint of a stabilized system anyways? the stabilization depends on the discretization...
      -> see supg_analysis.pdf
  -> what does the adaptivity theory rely on?
  
...aren't we inferring for a smooth source term, so regular stabilization should be fine?

debug:
nan residual?? after the linear solve...c doesn't seem to have moved from initial guess, based on qoi...also numerical and analytical jacobians don't match
  -> checking analytical jacobians takes a long time...on 46x33x3 mesh, two jacobians now match...still get nan...
  -> 5x5x3 should be small enough for matlab to read in without freezing...
    -nan whether supg toggled on or off
    -J is not full rank...311/432...fwd J was full rank, so shouldn't be about BCs of fwd+adjoint...
      -> if we view z as a forcing for f, then the gradient equation doesn't have a unique solution? is the regularization insufficient to make the problem well posed cuz it penalizes the gradient? is that why you chose forcing to be zero at boundaries?
      -> if f given homo Diri BCs, then J still not full rank (422/432) (485/504 for 5x6x3 mesh...)
      -> does giving either of the other BCs diri BCs fill up the remaining rank deficit?
        -f and c have homo diri: 352/432 O.o??
        -f and z have homo diri: 311/432
        -something wrong in interior? if all have homo diri and side residual contribution set to zero, still get nan's
          -interior terms look the same as in old cd_all inverse system...
          -matlab says rank is 417/432; if velocity increased to 2.415 (remove e-5 factor), then matlab thinks it's full rank...scaling problem? even with inceased velocity, still get nan...
          -do not get nan if superlu used with regular velocity, but then qoi becomes negative...same for original non-Diri BCs...
        
bart says he has an example that would be applicable to master's and easy to apply in milo?
--> focus on getting the two papers written and submitted this semester before opening more cans...will help you narrow down your ideas and see what work can/should still be done...and to understand what it means to have something finished...you should be expecting to get 2-3 papers from thesis...

karen will be at mit 4/6-7

date for forming committee is a guideline...
