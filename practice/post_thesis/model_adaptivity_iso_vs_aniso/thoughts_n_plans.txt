-> inverse prob for LF and HF; to avoid optimization algorithm, solve KKT system
  -> which adjoint system? stabilized adjoint or transposed of stabilized jacobian? for optimization problem where we care about a particular discretization, we want to use the transpose of the stabilized forward as the adjoint...
  -> is the adjoint of the stabilized system even the stabilized adjoint-of-unstabilized?
    -what is the meaning of the adjoint of a stabilized system anyways? the stabilization depends on the discretization...
  -> what does the adaptivity theory rely on?
