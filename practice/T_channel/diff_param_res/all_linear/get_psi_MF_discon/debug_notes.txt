something is wrong with the way Jacobian is assembled, it seems...
	-if LF everywhere, inexact Newton fails...
	-if HF everywhere, PETSC throws "argument out of range"...
	
if everything is made a field, inexact Newton fails for both LF and HF

if you remove the const variables, HF still fails inexact Newton; doesn't work until you remove active_subdomain argument to add_variable...

->can you reproduce with forward only? minimal working example to show vikram?

subdomain_ex2 okay if domain only has one subdomain, but breaks if one variable (the inactive one) changed to scalar; different Petsc error though...
