something is wrong with the way Jacobian is assembled, it seems...
	-if LF everywhere, inexact Newton fails...
	-if HF everywhere, PETSC throws "argument out of range"...
	
if everything is made a field, inexact Newton fails for both LF and HF

if you remove the const variables, HF still fails inexact Newton; doesn't work until you remove active_subdomain argument to add_variable...

-> can you reproduce with forward only? minimal working example to show vikram? ***
	-LOOKS LIKE SPLIT IS WORKING FOR DISCON (not HF, PETSC throws "argument out of range")...(poke harder; does linear exactness still hold? do a refinement run?)
		-fc has weird pinchy bits, though that may well be a product of how paraview plots it, since fconst looks funny at edges near subdomain interface...
		-for adjoint, in this case we don't need to linearize about fc, but if we did...scalar-patch field would have discontinuities and cannot be represented by field's basis fxs...fc, auxfc do show up in MHF_psiLF though...
		-***** psiHF_psiLF disagree between psiMF_split_discon and superadj_discon...also psiHF_psiLF = psiLF_psiLF in psiMF_split_discon?? that sounds resonable...but the disagreement is weird... *****
			MF: 0.0079611127609678298 (for mesh divvy currently in superadj_discon folder)
			HF: 0.0079417393840791068
	-using a scalar param only reduces your DOFs by 1/3 in deterministic case, so not likely to warrant solving for psi if both models are otherwise the same...

subdomain_ex2 okay if domain only has one subdomain, but breaks if one variable (the inactive one) changed to scalar; different Petsc error though...
